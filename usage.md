After you've [installed](/install.md) the app, go to the start menu and click on the Bates Numbering app.

Click on the button `Choose directory containing files to be stamped` and select the appropriate folder. In this case, it is the `docs` folder. Once you have the desired directory click `OK`.

Next, click on the `Choose output directory for stamped files` button and select the appropriate folder. In the example, it is the `stamped_docs` folder. Once you have your desired directory click `OK`. Note that if you do not select an output directory, the stamped files will be saved to your `Documents` folder.

Now you can choose a prefix for the Bates Number. Common prefixes are the name of a client or project. The resulting Bates Number will appear as e.g. "Smith000001". Type your prefix in the box labeled `Bates Prefix`.

The default position of the Bates Number is at the bottom center of the page. If this is okay, you can click the `Stamp!` button. Otherwise, tick the box labeled `Set text position manually`. Options to change the position of the Bates Number as well as its rotation will appear below. Note that the `x` and `y` parameters must be whole numbers. Increasing `x` will move the text towards the right of the page; increasing `y` will move the text towards to the top.

After clicking the `Stamp!` button a loading icon will appear until the job is finished. A box will then appear showing the location of your stamped files.

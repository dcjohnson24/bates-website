Click on the button 'Choose directory containing files to be stamped' and select the appropriate folder. In this case, it is the 'docs' folder. Once you have the desired directory click 'OK'.

Next, click on the 'Choose output directory for stamped files' button and select the appropriate folder. In the example, it is the 'stamped_docs' folder. Once you have your desired directory click 'OK'. Note that if you do not select an output directory, the stamped files will be saved to your 'Documents' folder.

Now you can choose a prefix for the Bates Number. Common prefixes are the name of a client or project. The resulting Bates Number will appear as e.g. "Smith000001". Type your prefix in the box labeled 'Bates Prefix'.

The default position of the Bates Number is at the bottom center of the page. If this is okay, you can click the 'Stamp!' button. Otherwise, tick the box labeled 'Set text position manually'. Options to change the position of the Bates Number as well as its rotation will appear below. Note that the 'x' and 'y' parameters must be whole numbers. Increasing 'x' will move the text towards the right of the page; increasing 'y' will move the text towards to the top.

After clicking the 'Stamp!' button, a loading icon will appear until the job is finished. A box will then appear showing the location of your stamped files.

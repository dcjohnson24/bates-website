Bates stamping is used to keep track of documents in the legal and medical fields. Each page is stamped with a number prefixed with a number of zeros e.g. '0000001', '0000002', etc. Although the numbers are applied electronically, the procedure is commonly referred to as stamping because Bates numbers were once stamped by hand.

The Bates stamping software will stamp each page of each document in a specified directory. The documents must be in PDF format. The user can customize the appearance of the numbers on the page and where the newly stamped documents will be saved. See [usage](/usage.md) for details.
